# Etiquette

This document describes the etiquette desired to create a pleasant atmosphere.
You can think of it as a supplement or extension of the rules. Everything here
is "softly defined" and is not meant as a cut and dry interpretation.

## R2. Be Nice
Surprisingly, this means you should be nice to eachother. Do not be dismissive
to someone else's opinion. This is not meant to encourage "*special snowflake*"
behavior, but to discourage unnecessary put downs. This also means no flame
wars.

Ex
```
A: "I prefer Vim"
B: "Vim sucks, Emacs is better"
```

Healthy debates about such topic are encouraged though. You never know what you
can learn from someone else.


## Links are king
If you find something particularly interesting on a website, share your source.
Playing [telephone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_whispers) by relaying
the page to make yourself seem smart is not helpful.


## Channels in Detail
A more in depth explanation about what topics the channels are meant to be used
for.

### general
A catch-all for everything not covered by the other channels.

### channel
For talking about specific videos or anything related to the Youtube channel or
its production.

### tech
Computers, electronics, multimedia, programming, and more. If electricity powers
it, discuss it here.

### games
Board or video, PC or console, old or new. Games go here.

### share
Show off things you've made or from others. This isn't really meant for "here's
a thing I bought"

### the-dmz
Memes, arguments with no possible resolution, low brow humor, talking for
talkings sake, fact dumps without context, and politics should all go here.

As note about politics; friendly discussion is fine, but things tend to get
heated. This usually makes others feel uncomfortable about joining it, which is
why I'd like to keep general clear, so other discussions can continue.

What counts as political discussion will be loosely defined as "Anything
countries typically make laws about". This will likely be determined on a
case-by case basis.
