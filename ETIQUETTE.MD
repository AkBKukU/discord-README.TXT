# Etiquette

This document describes the etiquette desired to create a pleasant atmosphere.
You can think of it as a supplement or extension of the rules. Everything here
is "softly defined" and is not meant as a cut and dry interpretation. 

## R2. Be Nice
Surprisingly, this means you should be nice to eachother. Do not be dismissive 
to someone else's opinion. This is not meant to encourage "*special snowflake*" 
behavior, but to discourage unnecessary put downs. This also means no flame 
wars.

Ex
```
A: "I prefer Vim"
B: "Vim sucks, Emacs is better"
```

Healthy debates about such topic are encouraged though. You never know what you 
can learn from someone else.
